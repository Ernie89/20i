20i.com Reseller API INTRODUCTIONThe 20i Reseller API gives you access to all the features and functionality of StackCP, allowing you to create a hosting control panel from scratch or integrate external services such as WHMCS. This is for advanced users and the support we provide for the Reseller API is service-based only.Where a URL needs an ID, this is typically an ID that you would get in the list method, but for some types alternative references may be supported:domain: The domain name package: A domain name on the package reseller: * to indicate yourself In general you should use the allocated ID instead as that will be more reliable for cases like moving names between packages.POSTs to approporiate endpoints can be either plain form (application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data) encoded as with PHP's http_build_query() or a JSON object (application/json).For example, to add a new web site, a form-style request could look like this:    POST /reseller/*/addWeb HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.20i.com
    Authorization: Bearer ZTRkNGZkMzFhNTJkY2FlMwo=
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    type=1234&domain_name=example.org&extra_domain_names[]=example.net&documentRoots[example.org]=public_html
Or in JSON:    POST /reseller/*/addWeb HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.20i.com
    Authorization: Bearer ZTRkNGZkMzFhNTJkY2FlMwo=
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "type": "1234",
      "domain_name": "example.org",
      "extra_domain_names": ["example.net"],
      "documentRoots": {
        "example.org": "public_html"
      }
    }
Example Script: This PHP script is an example of how to just get code working and using the 20i Reseller API, download the 20i Module and unzip the archive. Then create a test.php file with the following. When you run this code your should see all your package types dumped to the output window.    <?php

    include('lib/TwentyI/API/REST.php');
    include('lib/TwentyI/API/Services.php');

    $general_api_key = "API_KEY";
    $services_api = new \TwentyI\API\Services($general_api_key);

    $packageTypes = $services_api->getWithFields("/reseller/*/packageTypes");
    trigger_error( print_r($packageTypes,true) );
REFERENCE Domain Names
Domain Periods
List domain periods

List all possible domains that are supported with the periods that are supported for registration..    <?php
    $general_api_key = "API_KEY";

Domain Premium Type
Premium TLD Lookup

    $general_api_key = "API_KEY";
    $services_api = new \TwentyI\API\Services($general_api_key);

    $request = $services_api->getWithFields("/domainPremiumType");
Domain Search
Domain Search Lookup

Searches for one or more domain names. If you provide a domain name, this will search for that name only, otherwise it will search for that prefix on all supported TLDs. You may supply multiple literal domain names if you separate them with commas. You may supply arbitrary text, which will be stripped down to something suitable for domain search. This is typically useful with suggestions on. Under some circumstances this will attempt a detailed search, which will fetch more specific information about transferrable domains. This will happen if you search for one domain name. Domain Suggestions Our primary domain availability provider supports suggesting names based on the search, using simple semantic permutations of the supplied name(s). For example if you're searching for mailboxdelivery.com it might suggest post-delivery.com, mailboxsend.net and my-mailbox-delivery.com. These are supported only in a small set of TLDs (including .com, .net, .org, .info). These names are probably available, and will get properly checked at the end of the results, meaning that you will get two results: one marked "suggestion" and a later one which looks like a direct domain search result. At the current time, setting the TLDs to search is not supported. If a domain is returned which you aren't set up to sell, you should exclude it from your view. Note on responsiveness and order All results will be output at the earliest possible opportunity, and will be delivered in separate packets with each result hash on a line on its own. This means that the order will usually be different to the header order, and the output will look a little different to typical JSON responses. Usage limits Access to this service is subject to reasonable usage limits. If you go over the limit, further access will be blocked for up to 24 hours.    <?php

    $request = $services_api->getWithFields("/package/{packageId}/domain/{domainId}/dns");
Update DNS for a Domain Name

Updates the DNS records for the domain, if the DNS service is in use. Name prefixes are either plain names like "www" or "mail", or "@" to indicate that it applies to the domain itself (typically only AAAA, A or MX). NOTE: The platform may silently rewrite some adds into updates. NOTE: CNAMEs are special records (see RFC1034, with reference to RFC1912): they actually mean "no stop you're looking in the wrong place, ask instead for ". Thus on any name you can only have one of: (a)no records, (b) 1 CNAME, or (c) 1+ non-CNAME records (including SOA and NS). If you have a CNAME on a name and want to add records on that name, you should remove the CNAME (this may be done implicitly for you). If you have non-CNAME records on a name and want to add a CNAME on that name, you will have to delete every non-CNAME record on the name. In most cases, people using CNAME actually want "A/AAAA CNAME", ie. aliasing the A and AAAA records but nothing else (which the DNS protocol doesn't support). The distinction doesn't affect anything unless you have conflicting records on the same name, which usually is only the case for the root. Since browsers do not support _http._tcp SRV records (and don't intend to), you simply have to manually copy A or AAAA records in this case.    <?php

Domain Name Transfer

The "Transfer a Domain Name" API endpoint allows you to transfer a domain name to your 20i account using the 20i API.

To transfer a domain name, you need to provide the following parameters in the request payload: name: The domain name that you want to transfer. years: The number of years for which you want to transfer the domain. In most cases, this should be unset or set to 0 for UK transfers. contact: An array containing contact information for the domain. This includes the organization, name, address, telephone, email, and other details required for domain contact updates. emulateYears: If set to true, supplying years greater than 0 for registries that do not support years on transfer (e.g., .uk) will be treated as a transfer and renew operation. otherContacts: An optional array of additional contacts associated with the domain transfer. These contacts may be ignored for some transfers. authcode: The current EPP authcode required for CentralNIC transfers. limits: A limit code to value map that specifies domain limits for the transfer. nameservers: An array of nameserver hostnames for the domain. If not provided, default nameservers will be used. This parameter is ignored for UK transfers. privacyService: If set to true, domain privacy service will be added to the transfer order. Please note that this may not be applicable to some TLDs. stackUser: An optional parameter to grant access to a specific stack user. Upon successful execution of the API call, the response will return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer purchase was accepted. It's important to note that a successful response does not guarantee the success of the actual domain transfer process. Please note that you can also use the contract#add method instead of this method, as it performs a simple reformatting to use that method. Refer to the documentation of the contract#add method for more details. If there are insufficient funds in your 20i account balance to cover the transfer fee, the transfer will fail. The appropriate transfer fee and any additional charges for services like privacy will be deducted from your 20i account balance.    <?php
